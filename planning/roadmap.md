## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Godot learning curve | Medium | Tutorials, community, documentation |
| Multiplayer complexity | High | Start single-player, iterate slowly |
| Proc-gen bugs | Medium | Extensive testing, seed logging |
| Performance issues | Medium | Profile early, optimize continuously |

### Scope Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Feature creep | High | Strict MVP scope, defer non-essentials |
| Burnout | High | Sustainable schedule, small milestones |
| Loss of vision | Medium | Regular vision doc reviews |

### Market Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Saturated market | Low | Unique dual-world mechanic differentiates |
| Changing trends | Low | Core gameplay is timeless (Diablo, Valheim) |
| Player retention | Medium | Focus on "one more run" loop |

## Success Metrics
