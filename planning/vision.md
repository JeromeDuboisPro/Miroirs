# Miroirs - Dual-World 2D MMO

## High-Level Concept

**Miroirs** is a 2D multiplayer exploration and survival game featuring two interconnected parallel worlds that mirror and transform each other. Players navigate between a vibrant Light world of nature and an industrial Dark world of technology, where actions in one world create consequences in the other.

## Core Philosophy

**Fun, Addictive, Simple**
- Accessible gameplay that's easy to learn but deep to master
- Short play sessions (15-30 min) to epic journeys (200+ hours)
- Visual-first design with symbol-based UI (no language barriers)
- Epic moments in simple systems (One Punch Man-style combat finishers)

## The Hook: Dual-World Mirroring

Two parallel worlds exist at the same coordinates but with transformed content:

### ðŸŒž Light World - Organic/Chaotic
- Forests, creatures, flowing water
- Natural abundance and growth
- Vibrant, colorful, alive
- Nature-based resources

### ðŸŒ™ Dark World - Technological/Ordered
- Circuits, robots, geometric structures
- Industrial precision and systems
- Cyberpunk, neon-lit, mechanical
- Technology-based resources

**Neither world is "good" or "evil"** - both are necessary, both have value.

## Unique Features

### Transformation Cycle
- Resources gathered in Light â†’ Transform into tech resources in Dark
- Resources gathered in Dark â†’ Transform into natural resources in Light
- Creates bidirectional resource economy between worlds

### Death as Mechanic
- Death switches you between worlds
- Inventory transforms (wood â†’ metal, berries â†’ energy)
- 70% conversion rate (30% loss as penalty)
- Makes death strategic, not just punitive

### Spatial Mirroring
- Actions at position (X, Y) in Light affect position (X, Y) in Dark
- Cut tree in Light â†’ Scrap metal appears in Dark (same location)
- Harvest scrap in Dark â†’ Tree regrows in Light (same location)
- Creates asynchronous cooperation between players

### Static Portals
- Pre-placed portal locations in world generation
- Safe world-switching without death penalty
- 100% resource transformation, no location reset
- Valuable strategic points to discover and control

## Visual Style

**8-bit/Pixel Art Aesthetic**
- Retro pixel graphics with modern effects
- Clear visual language for gameplay clarity
- Rarity color-coding (white/green/blue/purple/orange)
- Epic combat animations with particle effects

## Inspirations

- **Valheim**: Procedural world generation, discovery, building, co-op
- **Diablo**: Loot rarity system, procedural item generation
- **One Punch Man**: Epic combat finishers, over-the-top action
- **Don't Starve**: Survival mechanics, resource gathering

## Target Experience

### Quick Run (15-30 minutes)
- Roguelite-style session
- Single biome per world
- Simple objective (defeat one boss)
- Fast-paced, arcade-like

### Epic Run (200+ hours)
- Persistent world with multiple biomes
- Progressive boss chain
- Complex crafting and building
- Community collaboration

## Design Pillars

1. **Dual-World Balance** - Every action has consequences across worlds
2. **Emergent Cooperation** - Players help each other without needing real-time coordination
3. **Universal Accessibility** - Symbol-based UI removes language barriers
4. **Configurable Depth** - Same mechanics scale from quick sessions to epic campaigns
5. **Strategic Death** - Death is a transformation tool, not just punishment

## Success Metrics

- Players understand dual-world mechanic within 5 minutes
- "Just one more run" addictiveness
- Strategic depth discovered through experimentation
- Cross-world cooperation feels natural and rewarding
- No language/text required to understand core gameplay

## Long-Term Vision

- Start: Single-player prototype to validate mechanics
- Phase 2: Local co-op and polish
- Phase 3: Online multiplayer (Valheim-style host + join)
- Phase 4: Dedicated servers, web version, mobile ports
- Content: Seasonal world resets, community events, modding support
